## Introduction
well_profile is a tool to generate or load well profiles in 3D. Features are added as they
are needed; suggestions and contributions of all kinds are very welcome.

## Documentation

See here for the [complete well_profile package documentation](https://well_profile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Get well_profile

* Users: Wheels for Python from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/well-profile/) 
    * `pip install well_profile`
* Developers: Source code from [Github](https://github.com/pro-well-plan/well_profile)
    * `git clone https://github.com/pro-well-plan/well_profile`
 
### Quick examples

Color by specified parameter: `e.g. 'dls'|'dl'|'tvd'|'md'|'inc'|'azi'`
```
import well_profile as wp
well = wp.load('trajectory1.xlsx')     # LOAD WELL
well.plot(style={'color': 'dls', 'size': 5}).show()
```

Also with dark mode:
```
well.plot(style={'darkMode': True, 'color': 'dls', 'size': 5}).show()
```

Plotting 3 wellbores:
* `Well 1 -> excel file: trajectory1.xlsx`
* `Well 2 -> generated well`
* `Well 3 -> excel file: trajectory2.xlsx`
```
import well_profile as wp
well_1 = wp.load('trajectory1.xlsx')      # LOAD WELL 1
well_2 = wp.get(6000, profile='J', kop=2000, eob=3000, build_angle=85, set_start={'east':2000})       # GET WELL 2 --> North: 0 m, East: 2000 m
well_3 = wp.load('trajectory2.xlsx', set_start={'north':-3000})        # LOAD WELL 3 --> North: -3000 m, East: 0 m
well_1.plot(add_well=[well_2, well_3],
            names=['first well name',
                   'second well name',
                   'third well name']).show()        # Generate 3D plot for well 1 including wells 2 and 3
```
